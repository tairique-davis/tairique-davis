# Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tairiquedavis/"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tairique Davis-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" />

##  About Me      
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a solid foundation in **programming, networking, and systems**, now channeling that background into a career in cybersecurity.  Iâ€™m driven by understanding how systems fail, thinking like an attacker, and strengthening defenses through smart detection and response.

---

##  Objective

My goal is to build a cybersecurity career focused on **threat analysis**, **incident response**, and **vulnerability management**.  
Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my technical skills, analytical mindset, and attention to detail to protect the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of critical systems.

Iâ€™m actively leveling up my skillset through hands-on labs, guided projects, and certifications.
