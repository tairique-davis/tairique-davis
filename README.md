</a>

Iâ€™m a recent Computer Science graduate with a solid foundation in **programming, networking, and systems**, now channeling that background into a career in cybersecurity.  
Iâ€™m driven by understanding how systems fail, thinking like an attacker, and strengthening defenses through smart detection and response.

---

##  Objective

My goal is to build a cybersecurity career focused on **threat analysis**, **incident response**, and **vulnerability management**.  
Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities to join a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** as a **Tier 1 Analyst**, where I can apply my technical skills, analytical mindset, and attention to detail to protect the **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of critical systems.

Iâ€™m actively expanding my skills through hands-on labs, guided projects, and certifications â€” continuously updating this portfolio as I grow.
